# HW1CodeRefactor

This Readme contains some of the changes made. I have been periodically pushing things to the repo, but the readme will contain more info. 

1. The first thing I did was remove extraneous divs. One such example was: 
```
   <div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
    <div>
```

2. The second thing I did was add alt text to all of the images. This was done with the help of an FOSS applet developed by the [Social Security agency](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html)
